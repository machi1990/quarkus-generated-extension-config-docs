== Details

[[quarkus.arc.remove-unused-beans]]
`quarkus.arc.remove-unused-beans`📦::  
 - If set to `all` (or `true`) the container will attempt to remove all unused beans. 
 - If set to none (or `false`) no beans will ever be removed even if they are unused (according to the criteria set out below) 
 - If set to `fwk`, then all unused beans will be removed, except the unused beans whose classes are declared in the application code  
 
 An unused bean:  
 - is not a built-in bean or interceptor, 
 - is not eligible for injection to any injection point, 
 - is not excluded by any extension, 
 - does not have a name, 
 - does not declare an observer, 
 - does not declare any producer which is eligible for injection to any injection point, 
 - is not directly eligible for injection into any `javax.enterprise.inject.Instance` injection point
