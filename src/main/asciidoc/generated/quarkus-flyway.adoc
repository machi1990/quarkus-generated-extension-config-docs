`quarkus.flyway.locations`📦:: Comma-separated list of locations to scan recursively for migrations. The location type is determined by its prefix. Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain both SQL and Java-based migrations. Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem, may only contain SQL migrations and are only scanned recursively down non-hidden directories.
