+
Type: `boolean` +
Defaults to: `false` +



`quarkus.keycloak.disable-trust-manager`📦:: If the Keycloak server requires HTTPS and this config option is set to true you do not have to specify a truststore. This setting should only be used during development and never in production as it will disable verification of SSL certificates

`quarkus.keycloak.register-node-period`📦:: Period for re-registration adapter to Keycloak. Useful when application is clustered
+
Type: `int` +

+
Type: `int` +
Defaults to: `0` +



`quarkus.keycloak.min-time-between-jwks-requests`📦:: Amount of time, in seconds, specifying minimum interval between two requests to Keycloak to retrieve new public keys. It is 10 seconds by default. Adapter will always try to download new public key when it recognize token with unknown kid. However it won’t try it more than once per 10 seconds (by default). This is to avoid DoS when attacker sends lots of tokens with bad kid forcing adapter to send lots of requests to Keycloak
+
Type: `int` +
Defaults to: `10` +



`quarkus.keycloak.public-key-cache-ttl`📦:: Amount of time, in seconds, specifying maximum interval between two requests to Keycloak to retrieve new public keys.

If it recognize token with known kid, it will just use the public key downloaded previously. However at least once per this configured interval (1 day by default) will be new public key always downloaded even if the kid of token is already known
+
Type: `int` +
Defaults to: `86400` +



`quarkus.keycloak.verify-token-audience`📦:: If set to true, then during authentication with the bearer token, the adapter will verify whether the token contains this client name (resource) as an audience.

+
Type: `boolean` +
Defaults to: `false` +
